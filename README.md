# Languages and Libraries Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Plotly, Statsmodels
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit, VS Code

# Key Learnings
1. Technical Skills:

- Developed proficiency in time series forecasting and feature engineering for temporal data.
- Enhanced skills in using machine learning libraries, especially XGBoost for high-performance modeling.
- Learned to handle data preprocessing steps systematically, including imputation and feature scaling.

2. Communication:

- Gained experience in presenting technical insights to a non-technical audience during a 5-minute presentation.
- Simplified complex concepts like RMSE and model evaluation for broader understanding.

3. Workflow Optimization:
   
- Practiced iterative improvement of the model, achieving a final RMSE of 257.4736.

# Challenges Overcame

1. Handling Missing Data:

- Markdown values had significant missing entries, which were imputed with zeros as they represented non-occurrences.

2. Feature Engineering:

- Creating meaningful features from holidays and promotional events required integrating external datasets and domain-specific  logic.

3. Model Deployment:

- Streamlit integration required careful planning to streamline the app’s forecasting tool and chatbot functionality without compromising user experience.

4. Balancing Performance and Interpretability:

- While achieving a high R² score (0.9995), efforts were made to ensure the model's decisions were interpretable and actionable for stakeholders.

# Additional Reflections

- The iterative model development process underscored the importance of continuous testing and evaluation to refine predictions.
- Building the Streamlit app emphasized the need for user-centric design in data science projects, ensuring tools are accessible to end users.
- This project reinforced the value of integrating domain knowledge with data science expertise for actionable insights in real-world applications.
